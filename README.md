Chat server implementation using SocketServer.IO in Java code for server-side and simple index.html for client-side. Added implementation improvement such as
- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
- Add support for nicknames.
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
- Show who’s online.
- Add private messaging.

Sooner implementation will create room and join room.
